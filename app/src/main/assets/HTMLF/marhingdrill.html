    <ul>
        <li>
                <b style="color:navy;">Fall In:</b> Have designated troops move into formation on the parade square and/or ground.
        </li><br>

        <li>
         <b style="color:navy">Fall Out:</b> Have designated troops to face the commander to be dismissed.
        </li><br>

        <li>
           <b style="color:navy">Dismissed:</b> Telling designated units to leave the parade square/ground.
        </li><br>

        <li><b style="color: navy;"> Stand Fast:</b> Individual soldiers remain at the attention position regardless of the movement of others in the formation</li><br>

        <h4><i style="color: red;">Rest positions</i></h4>
        <li>
           <b style="color: navy;">Stand at Ease:</b> (United States: <b>Parade Rest</b>) has the soldiers in a more relaxed position.
        </li><br>

        <li>
           <b style="color: navy;">Stand Easy:</b> (United States: <b>At Ease</b>) has the soldiers adopt the next easiest stance, where hands are still clasped behind the back, however, the soldiers can relax their upper bodies (the shoulders can be slacked) and quietly speak. This is often, but not always, followed by an implicit 'Relax' ('Rest'). This is typically used when being addressed/lectured for a long period of time where the positions of attention or at ease would be too painful/uncomfortable to hold.
        </li>
        <br>

        <li>
           <b style="color: navy;">Relax</b> (United States: <b>Rest</b>): The only parade instruction given in an ordinary voice, rather than the raised, emphatic parade voice. This is the only position that actually offers soldiers freedom of movement. Soldiers are typically allowed to move other than moving their feet, though, when it is given by a high-ranking officer, soldiers typically move a minimal amount after a bit of stretching.
        </li>

        <h4><i style="color: red;">Dressing</i></h4>
        <li>
           <b style="color: navy;">Right Dress:</b> All personnel except the right marker bring up their left arms parallel to the ground. At the same time, all members of the formation snap their heads so they are facing right. After this, they pause, and then shuffle back to a new position, where their hand is extremely close to the soldier's shoulder on their right, unless otherwise specified. The American version of this is called <b>Dress Right, DRESS</b>.
        </li><br>

        <li>
            <b style="color: navy;">Left Dress:</b> All personnel except the left marker bring up their right arms parallel to the ground. At the same time, all members of the formation snap their heads so they are facing left. After this, they pause, and then shuffle back to a new position, where their hand is extremely close to the soldier's shoulder on their right, unless otherwise specified. The American version of this is called <b>Dress Left, DRESS</b>.
        </li><br>

        <li>
           <b style="color: navy;">Inwards Dress/Centre Dress:</b> Used when a parade is formed up in two or more groups with Colours, Guidons, or Banners on parade. This is used so that dressing is off the colours. The formations to the left of the Colour Party will dress to the right and the formations to the right of the Colour Party will dress to the left. All personnel to the right of the Colours in front row and left column except the left marker take one step forward, pause, and only the front rank bring up their left arms parallel to the ground. At the same time, all members of the formation snap their heads so they are facing left. All personnel to the left of the colours in front row and right side column except the right marker take one step forward, pause, and only the front rank bring up their right arms parallel to the ground. At the same time, all members of the formation snap their heads so they are facing right.
        </li><br>

        <li><b style="color: navy;">Eyes Front (United States:Ready Front):</b> The front rank snaps their arms down and faces forward, while all other ranks simply face forward.</li><br>

        <li>
           <b style="color: navy;">Eyes Front (United States:Ready Front):</b> The front rank snaps their arms down and faces forward, while all other ranks simply face forward.
        </li>

        <h4 style="color: red;"><i>Forming the parade for the march past/pass in review</i></h4>

        <li>
           <b style="color:navy;">Pass in Review:</b> Used in the US to denote the start of the march past segment of parades. When this command is said the parade prepares in readiness for the march past. It is also used as a way for a newly assigned commander to inspect the troops he/she commands.
        </li><br>

        <li>
            <b style="color: navy;">Parade, in close order, left/right dress:</b> In the UK, this command is used to commence dressing of parade units in close order.
        </li><br>

        <li>
            <b style="color: navy;">Company, in close order, form three/four ranks:</b> In the UK, this command is used to form companies into three or four ranks of personnel each.
        </li><br>

        <li>
            <b style="color: navy;">Staff behind me, (forward) march:</b> In the US, this command is used by the parade commander to form his parade staff in readiness for the march past/pass in review segment of parades.
        </li><br>

        <li>
            <b style="color: navy;">Parade will now advance/retire in slow/quick time, about turn:</b> In the Commonwealth the command is used to form parade formations when arranged in line formation for the march past.
        </li><br>

        <li>
            <b style="color: navy;">Move to the right/left in twos/threes/fours:</b> In the Commonwealth, this command is used for a company or companies to execute left/right turn forming either two, three or four ranks.
        </li>

        <h4><i style="color: red;">Marching motions</i></h4>
        <li>
           <b style="color: navy;">Quick March:</b> The standard pace is typically 116 beats/minute with a 30in. step. There is also a <b>Rifleman's Pace</b>, 140 beats/minute and a <b>Highland Pace</b>, 110 beats/minute (typically done with a kilt.) The pace is based on the individual regiments, the pace given by the commander, and the speed of the band's rhythm. The way the march is performed depends on the regiment's nationality.
        </li><br>

        <li>
           <b style="color: navy;">Slow March:</b> This is a ceremonial pace, used for funerals and when a unit's colours are marched out in front of the troops. The standard pace is 65 beats per minute.
        </li><br>

        <li>
           <b style="color: navy;">Half Step March or Cut the pace:</b>
            <ul>
                <li>
                    This is a U.S. march pace. It is at the same tempo as Quick Time, but instead of 30 inches, the step is 15 inches.
                </li><br>

                <li>
                    There is also a Canadian and Commonwealth version of this, used for when the front file/rank is getting too far ahead of the rest of the flight, squad, or platoon, it means that front file/rank should make their steps smaller, to allow for the rest of the flight, squad, or platoon, to get back into a proper dressing.
                </li>
            </ul>
        </li><br>

        <li>
            <b style="color: navy;">Double March:</b> This is essentially a moderate jog at approximately 180 paces per minute. It creates a travel speed of approximately double that of Quick Time, designed to be used even when carrying heavy burdens. This is often erroneously used to describe a sprint or an ordinary run. The U.S. command is <b>"Double Time, MARCH."</b>
        </li><br>

        <li>
           <b style="color: navy;">Easy March:</b> This is an unrestricted march at approximately Quick Time. This is designed for field marches and other rough conditions, though is not used in combat areas. The U.S. command is "Route Step, MARCH." In the Canadian Forces the command "March at, EASE" is given while the unit is on the march. It can not be given from the halt.
        </li><br>

        <li>
           <b style="color: navy;">Mark Time:</b> This is essentially a stationary march with the knees coming up parallel to the ground or the foot dangling six inches off of the ground. This is designed to maintain the time of large parades when portions need no forward speed. The U.S. equivalent command is <b>"Mark Time, MARCH."</b>
        </li><br>

        <li>
        <b style="color: navy;">Step For -Ward or Forward or Forward, March:</b> This causes troops marking time to resume a normal march.
        </li>

        <h4 style="color:red">Turning motions at the march</h4>
        <li>
           <b style="color:navy">Right Turn (U.S.:Column right, MARCH):</b> A 90° turn to the right done by rotating on the right heel and left ball. The cautionary and executive are both called on the left foot. The left leg is then brought up to be parallel to the ground (although exceptions are made for kilted regiments) and slammed into the ground in the position of attention. This motion is done at a particular fixed point.
        </li>
        <br>

        <li>
           <b style="color:navy">Left Turn (U.S.:Column left, MARCH):</b> A 90° turn to the left, done by rotation on the right ball and the left heel. The right leg is then brought up to be parallel to the ground and slammed down into attention. This motion is done at a particular fixed point.
        </li>
        <br>

        <li>
           <b style="color:navy">About Turn (U.S.: To the rear, MARCH):</b> A 180° turn to the right, done as an exaggerated version of the right turn. United States units do not make exaggerated gestures with the legs or arms.
        </li>
        <br>

        <li>
           <b style="color:navy">Right Flank MARCH or Right turn:</b> It is still the same even on the march for some countries: All members marching execute 90° turn to the right done by rotating on the right heel and left ball.
        </li>
        <br>

        <li>
           <b style="color:navy">Left Flank MARCH or Left turn:</b> It is still the same even on the march for some countries: All members marching 90° turn to the left, done by rotation on the right ball and the left heel.
        </li>
        <br>

        <li>
           <b style="color:navy">Right Incline (U.S.:Column half-right, MARCH):</b> Is a half turn to the right, usually used when a flight, squad, platoon, etc. is not in its proper alignment. All members marching turn by 45° to the right, done by rotation on the left ball and the right heel.
        </li>
        <br>

        <li>
           <b style="color:navy">Left Incline (U.S.:Column half-left, MARCH):</b> is a half turn to the left, usually used when a flight, squad, platoon, etc. is not in its proper alignment. All members marching turn by 45° to the left, done by rotation on the right ball and the left heel.

        <br>

        <li><br>
           <b style="color:navy">Left Wheel:</b> Is a mirror of the Right Wheel.
        </li>
        <br>

        <h4 style="color:red">Marching with colours</h4>
        <li>
           <b style="color:navy">Let Fly the Colours:</b> The colours are normally held in a semi-taut position. This is a simple, ceremonial letting fly and catching of the colours.
        </li>
        <br>

        <li>
           <b style="color:navy">Slant Colours:</b> The colours are normally kept upright, but this can represent a problem both when dealing with standard doors. This slants the colours forward sufficiently to negate this, and they are brought back up afterward.
        </li>
        <br>

        <li>
           <b style="color:navy">March on/off (Retire) the Colours:</b> This vocal command by the parade commander orders the colour guard or massed colour guards either to get into position or prepare for departure in the parade square or ground during the ceremony.
        </li>

        <li>
           <b style="color:navy">Order Colours:</b> Essentially the same as Order Arms, except used exclusively for the Colour Party.
        </li>
        <br>

        <li>
           <b style="color:navy">Carry Colours:</b> This is equivalent to Shoulder Arms. The right arm lifts the colours up so they line up with the body's centre line, with the right arm held in front of the soldier, at mouth level parallel to the ground. It is caught and guided into its frog with the left hand, which is then returned to its side.
        </li>
        <br>


        <li>
           <b style="color:navy">Change colours:</b> This is used when the senior flag officer decides that he/she and the other flag holding members, have held their flags for a long time, and that their arms are tired, so, when the command "Change - colours!" is given, the flag holders put their arms in line with the flag, their other hand on top of their first hand and move the first hand down to attention, so that the other hand is now at the first hands' original position
        </li>
        <br>

        <h4 style="color:red">Compliments on the March</h4>
        <li>
           <b style="color:navy">Eyes Right:</b> The parade turn their heads to the right after a check pace. The parade leader salutes while looking in the direction they gave.
            <br>
            This is done while looking to the right, except the right marker, who must stay looking to the front, to keep the flight, squad, platoon, etc. staying straight.
        </li>
        <br>

        <li>
           <b style="color:navy">Eyes Left:</b> Similar to the Eyes Right except the parade looks to the left.
            <br>
            This is done while looking to the left, except the left marker, who must stay looking to the front, to keep the flight, squad, platoon, etc. staying straight.
        </li>
        <br>

        <h4 style="color:red">Saluting at the halt (static)</h4>
        <li>
           <b style="color:navy">To the front Salute or Salute:</b> The right arm is raised so the forearm is placed at a 90° angle, while pointing at the temple. It is generally to a count of "Up, two, three, down!"
        </li>
        <br>

        <li>
           <b style="color:navy">To the Right Salute:</b> The right arm is raised so the forearm is placed at a 90° angle, while pointing at the temple. It is generally to a count of "Up, two, three, down!"
        </li>
        <br>

        <li>
           <b style="color:navy">To the Left Salute:</b> The right arm is raised so the forearm is placed at a 90° angle, while pointing at the temple. It is generally to a count of "Up, two, three, down!"
            <br>
            In the United States, salutes at a halt are given on the command "Hand Salute". They are lowered in the same amount of time elapsed between the two words. The command "present arms" will cause the command to salute if the command is not given rifles for the ceremony, but the salute will be held until they are ordered to lower it with the command "order arms".
        </li>
        <br>

        <li>
           <b style="color:navy">Advance in Review Order, by the centre, Quick March:</b> This is used to pay final compliments to the reviewing officer. On this very command the unit being reviewed advances 15 paces and halts automatically before presenting arms to the reviewing officer
        </li>
