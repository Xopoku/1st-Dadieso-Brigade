<h4><i><u>BOYS BRIGADE (B.B) KNOWLEDGE</u></i></h4>
<img src="bbboys.jpg">
<div class="boys">

    <div class="bh-boys"> <b style="color: red;" class="BH-boys">Brief History of the Boys Brigade</b></div>

    <p>The boy’s brigade was found by <b style="color: navy;">Sir Alexander Williams Smith</b>. He was born in Glasgow, Scotland in <b style="color: red;"> <i>October 27th, 1854.</i> </b>
        William A. Smith was an Army Officer before the lord called him for his work; he abandoned his military service and became a Sunday school Teacher at Free Church mission, Northwood side hall in Glasgow Scotland. It was found during the time parents left their children uncared for. Therefore, children became wild, undisciplined and were not properly thought with the Bible, hence as an enthusiastic Sunday school Teacher, he discovered what was going on and applied his military knowledge forming what is called <b style="color: navy;"><i>BOYS BRIGADE</i></b> in order to see that children hears the word of God.
        Though this Boys Brigade organization started with many boys but due to some of the disobedience which many of our companies are facing today made some of the boys ran away due to the hard (harsh) training in Brigade. So they remained only <b style="color: red;">31</b> boys including <b style="color: navy;"><i>Sir William A. Smith </i></b> and these were the people that formed Brigade.
        Brigade started with <b style="color: red;">28</b> boys and <b style="color: red;">3</b>  officers on <b style="color: navy;">4th October 1883</b> at Northwood side hall Free Church mission Glasgow, Scotland. It was known as the 1st Glasgow Company in Scotland. The name of the 3 officers are <b style="color: navy;">JOHN B. HILL, JAMES R. HILL <b style="color: #000;">and</b> SIR WILLIAM A. SMITH</b>. The remaining 28 boys were shared into 3 group; Company boys, Senior boys and Junior boys.
        Sir William A. Smith became a knight in the year <b style="color: red;">1909</b>. He died on <b style="color: navy;">10th May, 1914</b> at the age of 60 years after the work that God gave him to do.
        The Boys Brigade is the first Christian uniformed organization formed in the world.

    <div class="bh-boys"> <b style="color: red;" class="BH-boys">MOTTO OF BOYS' BRIGADE</b></div>
    <p>
        The motto of Boys’ brigade is <b style="color: navy;"><i>“SURE & STEADFAST”</i></b> (Hebrews 6:9)

    </p>

</div>

<div class="bh-boys"> <b style="color: red;" class="BH-boys">THE BOYS BRIGADE GAZETTE</b></div>
<img src="bblogoimg.png">
<p>
    The BB crest is a unique one which has its origin from the bible <b style="color:navy"><i>"Which we have as the ANCHOR of the soul, both a Sure
    and a Steadfast"</i></b> (Heb. 6:19). Thus as a Christened youth organisation, the whole make-up of BB has emblem, logo, anchor or badge.
    On <b style="color:red"><i>24<sup>th</sup> November, 1926</i></b> the BB crest was designed by the founder Sir William Smith in 1883 from the Lanarkshire Rifle
    Volunteers logo was amalgamated with the logo of <b style="color:navy"> <i> THE BOYS' LIFE BRIGADE.</i></b> Upon the merger between one organization, the red Greek cross was placed
    behind the anchor to form the current emblem. This  shows acceptance and unity between two different organisation
</p>

<div class="bh-boys"> <b style="color: red;" class="BH-boys">PARTS OF THE CREST</b></div>
<div>
    The BB crest is made up of five (5) major parts:
<ol>
    <li>
        <b style="color:navy">THE ANCHOR:</b>
        The Anchor as used by sea transporters is used to hold the ship firm to the sea bed when turbulent arises and when strong waves
        and storms wages itself. it also supports the ship, prevents it from sinking or tossing when on-board. Bilically speaking, the
        Anchor of our Soul from the BB motto is CHRIST. As trials, temptations and troubles come our way, our faith in Christ holds us firm,
        saving us from the ranging storms that arise.
    </li><br>

    <li>
        <b style="color:navy">THE RED CROSS (The Geneva's Cross):</b>
        As explained above, the Red Cross was introduced into the BB crest in 1926 to mark our amalgamation with the life Boys' Brigade, it stands as a reminder to
        to our calling to advance Christ Kingdom, thus the redness represents the pain and sorrow Christ experienced in the cross for our sins and the blood he shaded to redeem us,
        while the eminent nature of the cross (being equal at the four edges) represents the four cardianl points which reaches out to the whole world, thus stressing that the gospel of BB is for all nations and as well the four regions of the human body <i>i.e.</i>
        the head, the hands and the legs thus representing the human body.
        Anyone who does not identify with the Red Cross shall face eternal torment.
    </li><br>

    <li>
        <b style="color:navy">THE CHAIN:</b>
        The chain or rope holds the BB anchor (Christ) firm to the Red Cross (our body), thus no matter the challenges life will put through,
        our body is always fastened against the body of Christ, and there lies our hope. When the chain is cut, the Boy loses focus and thus
        sink into sin and immorality.
    </li><br>

    <li>
        <b style="color:navy">THE LETTER "BB":</b>
        The letter meaning "Boys' Brigade" has a direct contact with the Red Cross and the Anchor, thus meaning the Boys' Brigade as an organization is forever united with Christ who is our captain and our body.
        The three come together and forms an inseparable triangle.
    </li><br>


    <li>
        <b style="color:navy">THE MOTTO "Sure &amp; Steadfast":</b>
        Sure and Steadfast is picked up from the bible; it asserts the confirmation of Jesus' readiness to stand by us in whatever circumstances,
        believing that Jesus Christ is the Anchor of our soul. If one is in Jesus, he is Sure of eternal life for he will save us from any trouble that may come our way.
    </li>
