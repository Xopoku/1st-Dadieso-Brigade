<h4><i><u>ASSOCIATION OF METHODIST BRIGADES (AMB)</u></i></h4>
<div class="boys">


    <p>
        The association of the Methodist Brigades is the umbrella body for all The Boys’ Brigade Companies and The Girls’ Brigade Companies in the Methodist Church.


    </p>

    <p>It was established to enhance the formation of more new Companies, to revive the dormant ones and to ensure the effective participation of both BB and GB in the life of the Church as well as being more relevant within the main bodies and grow membership numerically.</p>

    <div class="bh-boys"> <b style="color: navy;" class="BH-boys"><i>AMB Aims and Objectives</i></b></div>
    <div>
    <ul>
        <li>To deepen members’ understanding of the Methodist faith and the Christian faith, and its application to personal, social and economic life.</li>
        <li>To encourage members to render services to the Methodist Church.</li>
        <li>To help members to come to have a personal faith in Jesus Christ as their Savior.</li>
        <li>To provide activities designed to help members attain physical, mental and spiritual maturity.</li>
        <li>To foster great fellowship and cooperation among all members of the AMB.</li>
        <li>To educate members on the doctrines of the Methodist Church, thus inculcating in them a sense of belonging, discipline, commitment and discipleship.</li>
    </ul>

    </div>
</div>

<h4 style="text-align: center; color: rgb(17, 17, 170); font-size: 20px;">HISTORY &amp; OTHER THINGS OF AMB - GHANA</h4>
<div style="text-align: justify; font-family: 'Times New Roman', Times, serif; font-size: 21px;">
    <p>
        THE Constitution and Standing Orders of The Methodist Church Ghana (SO 231) allows for the formation of the Boys’ and Girls’ Brigade Companies as a uniformed organisation in the Church.
    </p>

    <p>
        The 1<sup>st</sup> Methodist Boys’ Brigade was thus formed in 1952 by Mr. J.K. Koomson at the Wesley Methodist Society, Asafoatse Nettey Road, Accra.  Also, the 1<sup>st</sup> Methodist Girls’ Brigade was formed in 1955 through the efforts of Mrs. Gladys Eunancy Dagadu at the Wesley Methodist Society on the Asafoatse Nettey Road, Accra.  Thereafter, formation of the Boys’ and Girls’ Brigade Companies in The Methodist Church Ghana continued in various parts of Accra, Cape Coast, Sekondi, Kumasi, Anomabo and beyond.
    </p>

    <p>
        It was the dream of both Rev. Peter Kwei Dagadu of blessed memory, who was a pioneer for youth work in The Methodist Church, and of the late Mr. G. K. B. De-Graft Johnson, who, long before his death was the National President of the Boys’ Brigade Ghana Council, to bring all the Methodist Brigade Companies together. They, however, did not live to see the fulfilment of their dreams but we know that they will rejoice rather than turn in their graves over this development. We also recognise the contributions of Mr. Harry Reynolds, Mr. A. K. A. Yawson and Mrs. Ophelia Koran, renowned Brigade members, just to mention a few, who also assisted immensely in that direction.
    </p>

    <p>
        Quarterly Meetings, Synods and Conferences were continually provided with reports of their performance and policies and feedback had been taken back to these units. The Conference subsequently appointed Mr. Harry Reynolds and Mrs. Nancy Quansah, both of blessed memory, as interim National Organisers for the Boys’ and Girls’ Brigades, respectively to enhance communication and development within the Methodist set-up.
    </p>

    <p>
        This move was, however, still inadequate because there was still no channel through which information from the top could easily and quickly reach local Brigade Companies in the Connexion, since the Methodist Conference took that decision in 1987; which directed that National Committees for the Boys’ and Girls’ Brigades within the Methodist Church be formed followed by District and Circuit Committees.
    </p>

    <p>
        It had not been easy forming these because the Brigades are international, Christian/interdenominational, uniformed, activity-based, Christian organisations and companies owe allegiance to the National Boys’ Brigade and National Girls’ Brigade Councils. This decision raised a lot of protest because it was feared the Methodist would break away from the Ghana Councils. Promises were also made to start the fellowship which never materialised.
        History was finally made at the St. Paul Methodist Church, Tema from March 16 to 18, 1990. By the Grace of God, the Methodist Brigades (Boys’ and Girls’) in the Connexion came together to form the Connexional Committees with Mr. Harry Reynolds and Mrs. Ophelia Koran as leaders.
    </p>

    <p>
        These Committees were long overdue because they were conceived years ago as important instrument for the setting up of structures to ensure and monitor training of teenagers within the Methodist Church in line with the Objectives, Aims and Principles of the Boys’ and Girls’ Brigades.
    </p>

    <p>
        In 1997, therefore, at the Methodist Youth Development and Training Centre,Aburi, the Reverends Isaac Nana Abekah and Solomon Eshun, then District Youth Organisers of Sunyani and Sekondi Districts respectively, were charged to revise the formation of the Association. The issue was fruitfully discussed. The then Director of the Youth Ministries Division, Rev. E.G.L.  Twum-Baah had no option than to allow for the formation of a Committee to oversee the organisation.  The late Rev. Yaw Obeng, then Tarkwa District Youth Organiser, was chosen as the Leader of the Committee to revive all the Companies of the Methodist Brigades.
    </p>

    <div>
        The terms of reference were to:-
        <ol>
            <li>Form District and Circuit Associations and to help resuscitate all the defunct Companies within the Methodist Church (both Boys and Girls). </li> <br>
            <li>Form new Brigade Companies in all the Circuits throughout the Connexion. </li><br>
            <li>Rekindle and promote evangelism in the Companies based on the Objectives, Aims and Principles of the Brigades.  </li>
        </ol>
    </div>

    <p>
        Subsequently, a team comprising Brothers Isaac Afriyie-Boateng from Kumasi, Isaac Kwame Enninful, Sunyani, and David Nzima-Mensah, Tarkwa and Sisters Victoria Omane-Achamfuo, Sunyani and Theodora LomokiNartey, Sekondi were appointed and charged to see to the affairs of the Association in the Dioceses.  Later Sister Gifty Ginna Ussher (Asamoah) of the then enterprising Tema Diocese joined them.
    </p>

    <p>
        They planned and organised the first Connexional Conference in April, 1999 at the Wesley Grammar Secondary School in Accra and the following were duly elected at the end of the Conference as the Premier Connexional Officers: -

        It has to be emphasised that there has been a lot of improvement in terms of communication, commitment, revivals, spiritual and Christian education.
    </p>

    <p>
        Chaplains and officers of Brigade Companies in the Methodist Church are to earnestly work towards the realisation of the objectives for which the Brigades were established which translate into leading the Child to God and help win souls for the Lord.

        <div style="color: rgb(11, 11, 129); text-align: center;"><b>THE METHODIST FLAG (Colour)</b></div>
        During the tenure of office of the Most Rev. Dr Robert Aboagye-Mensah as the Presiding Bishop of the Church, the then Director of the Youth Ministries Directorate, Very Rev. Isaac Nana Abekah, and the then Connexional Co-ordinator, Bro. Isaac Afriyie-Boateng, pursued the raising of Methodist flag alongside the traditional Brigade flags to promote the Methodist image and also to inculcate in members of the Association the richness of the Methodist heritage.

    </div>

    <p>
        Consequently, they presented a sample flag which design was the collection of ideas from officers and for which the 2005 Connexional AMB Conference at Wenchi accepted for the consideration and approval of the General Purposes Council (GPC).  The Conference of the Church in 2006 subsequently adopted the Methodist Church Ghana Flag for use.
    </p>

    <p>
        The Flag was officially unveiled in November, 2006 at the Ebenezer Methodist Chapel, Bantama-Kumasi on behalf of the Presiding Bishop by the Rt. Rev. Nuh Ben Abubekr, the then Bishop of Kumasi Diocese and assisted by the Very Rev. Isaac Nana Abekah, and Bro. Isaac Afriyie-Boateng, the 1st Connexional Co-ordinator.
    </p>


    <div>
        <div style="color: rgb(11, 11, 129); text-align: center;"><b>ANNUAL FLAG-RAISING CEREMONY</b></div>
        Flags have been used as distinguishing marks for a formation and as symbols of the spirit and tradition of that formation closely allied to the spirit and tradition of the State, Church, Society and the Brigade Companies.
    </div>


    <p>
        Flags so consecrated are called “Colours” and those who carry them are called Colour–Bearers. Each colour bearer has an Escort who guide the colour from falling. In The Methodist Church Ghana, the Brigades are the custodians of the colours.
    </p>

    <p>
        In November, 2006, The Methodist Church Ghana approved the introduction of the Methodist flag in addition to the already existing three Colours in the order of National, Denominational, Girls’ and Boys’ Brigades respectively.
    </p>

    <p>
        In July, 2013, the Annual Flag Raising in remembrance of The Methodist Church Ghana autonomy from the British Methodist Conference on July 28, 1961 was instituted with the Brigades playing the lead role.
    </p>

    <p>
        The meaning of the various signs of the Methodist emblem (Flag) was also reduced into writing by the Very Rev. Isaac Nana Abekah, to help members appreciate the Methodist flag as raised.
    </p>

    <p>
        This flag is raised to remind us of the fact that even though we share in the ecumenical body, we are, first and foremost, Christians of the great Methodist Tradition.  We are proud to have come to faith in Jesus Christ by the gospel preached, taught and practiced by the people called Methodists.  A society raised by the power of God to spread scriptural holiness throughout the land.  It is, therefore, important that every Methodist within a diocese, circuit and society in the Connexion owns and raises it in the Offices, Schools and the Chapels.

    <p style="font-family: 'Times New Roman', Times, serif; font-size: 19px;">The need to strategise became more urgent than ever before, considering the growing sophistication of modern society as a result of technology, i.e.:  the Internet, and the emergence of social media platforms and their impact on us as Christians, particularly as regards the younger generation that we lead.

        <li style="font-family: 'Times New Roman', Times, serif; font-size: 21px;">
            The 5th Biennial Connexional Delegates’ Conference hosted by the Sekondi Diocese in August, 2007, recommended for approval by the Church, the Logo and the Colour of the Lacoste for use by members of the Association. It was designed by Bro. Benjamin Jackson Sam, Calvary Society, Amakom – Kumasi.

                The Connexional Executive Committee, in collaboration with the Connexional Youth Council of the Youth Ministries Directorate, met at Aburi on October 13 and 14, 2012 and decided on the salutation, slogan and motto for the Association after a proposal has been sent to the Apex body.
            </div>

            <p>
                The Association is grateful to the Rev. Michael C. Acquah, then Sekondi Diocesan Youth Organiser, who was tasked by the Youth Ministries Directorate to look for a scriptural passage that will give credence to a slogan envisaged for the Association. He then came up with the following:
                <br><b>Greetings:</b> AMB  <br> <b>Response:</b> The Lord Reigns
            </p>


            <div><br><br>
                <div style="color: rgb(11, 11, 129); text-align: center;"><b>BACKGROUND  </b></div>
                This was arrived at in fulfilment of the Objectives, Aims and Principles of the Brigades. The fact that the Association is to promote the Kingdom of Christ and His rules, now and for His coming Kingdom.  Members are to be helped to understand that our Lord Jesus Christ reigns now and forever.  Therefore, Psalm 96: 10 is seen as most appropriate.  It reads as follows: - “Say among the nations “The Lord REIGNS.
                The word is firmly established, it cannot be moved:
                He will judge the people with equity.” (NIV)

            </div>

            <p>
                The General Purposes Council (GPC) of the Church met in Accra on November 22, 2012 and accordingly approved the salutation and slogan for use by the Association alongside the existing salutation of the Boys’ and Girls’ Brigades which is BB: Sure & Steadfast; and GB: Seek, Serve & Follow Christ.

                <div style="color: rgb(11, 11, 129); text-align: center;"><b>THE ASSOCIATIONS’ BYE-LAWS </b></div>
                The Church approved the bye-laws to regulate the activities of the Association and was first published and circulated in 2007 at the Sekondi Conference.
            </div>

            <p>
                In 2012, the Alpha Royal Publications published the second printing (First Revised Edition) of the bye-laws which was funded by the Church Headquarters at a cost of GH¢3,000.00.  The then Lay President, Bro. J.E. K. Pratt, unveiled the second (2012) edition of the bye-laws on Sunday, February 24, 2013, at the Wesley Methodist Cathedral, Effiduase where it was inaugurated.

                <div style="color: rgb(11, 11, 129); text-align: center;"><b>THE LORD REIGNS BOOK </b></div>
                In pursuance of our objective to ensure improvement in the Christian life of our members, the Connexional Executive Committee developed a write-up on the slogan of the Association <b style="color: red;">“THE LORD REIGNS”</b>.
                The Leadership of the Association in operationalising the Motto in 2013 realised that most members of the Association lacked personal knowledge of God, His Lordship and what is required of them to appreciate Christ as the Lord of their lives.  Accordingly, Bro. Kingsley Frimpong Tandor, a past GHAMSU National Secretary was mandated, to write the book entitled <b style="color: red;">‘THE LORD REIGNS’</b>, for which we are most grateful to him.
                The book therefore seeks to help cultivate an atmosphere where members of the Association would long for a personal encounter with Christ and a living faith in Him.

                The Rt. Rev. Dr. John Kweku Buaben-Odoom, the Bishop of Winneba Diocese, wrote the foreword to the Book for which the Association is thankful.

            </div>

            <p>
                The book, which printing was funded by the Association through the generousity of some of our patrons and patronesses, was launched at the Annual Captains and Officers Seminar that took place a year later in Cape Coast on Friday February 7, 2014 by the Director of the Youth Ministries Directorate, Very Rev. Dr. Isaac Nana Abekah.

                The Director of the Youth Ministries Directorate, the Very Rev. Dr. Isaac Nana Abekah, championed and promoted the need for the Association to have a corporate cloth in 2010.  In collaboration with the Connexional Officers at the time, a designed sample was sent to the General Purposes Council (GPC) through the Youth Ministries Directorate for approval for the Association to print the cloth.

            <p>
                The Methodist Church Conference discussed and approved of the maiden production of the Association’s Corporate Cloth during the tenure of office of Bro. Isaac Kwame Enninful as the Connexional Co-ordinator. And it was designed by Bro. Benjamin Jackson Sam, Calvary Society, Amakom – Kumasi.

            </p>

            <p>
                The initial capital of GH¢11,000.00 to produce the first 300 hundred pieces from PRINTEX LIMITED in 2012 was secured through the instrumentality of Brothers R. C. Gordon-Mensah,  Connexional Co-ordinator, and R. N. A. Amartey, Connexional Secretary.
                The cloth with its approved style for both male and female officers, was officially launched to the glory of God by the then Lay President, Bro. J. E. K. Pratt, the then Administrative Bishop, Rt. Rev. Dr Kweku Asamoah-Okyere, the Youth Ministries Director, Very Rev. Dr. Isaac Nana Abekah, and the then Synod Secretary of Tema Diocese, Very Rev. Thomas Brown Forson, at the St. Paul Methodist Cathedral, Tema, on Sunday, July 15, 2012.

                By the year 2009, it came to our notice that The Methodist Church Nigeria also has the
                Association of Methodist Brigades.  Immediately after the 6th Biennial Delegates’ Conference at Koforidua Diocese, an International Exchange programme was planned at which 10 Reverend
                Ministers and Ninety-nine AMB members participated from Ghana to Lagos-Mainland, Nigeria.
                That gave birth to the formation of the Association of Methodist Brigades-International

They have since been inducted into office as Connexional Patrons and Patronesses at various locations throughout the Connexion and presented with certificates of appointment and decorated with regalia of office which was designed by Bro. Benjamin Jackson Sam of the Kumasi Diocese; a Connexional Treasurer.

                The Connexional Band Festival was introduced in 2007 during the Connexional Conference hosted by the Sekondi Diocese at the Dunwell Methodist Chapel, Effiekuma-Takoradi with the following objectives: -
            </div>

            <div>
                <ul>
                    <li>
                        To bring the Boys and Girls closer to the Officers to share with them programmes that will be beneficial to them.
                    </li>

                    <div>
                        <li>
                            To inculcate the sense of Methodism in the Boys and Girls and to encourage them (the band unit) to learn and play the familiar Methodist Hymns and other tunes.
                        </li>
                    </div>

                    <div><li>
                        To infuse in the Band Units the professional playing of the regimental band instruments in order to get them enlisted in the Security Services.
                    </li></div>

                    <div><li>
                        To equip the band units with the knowledge of the tunes used during our regular church services so as to enable them to participate actively in the music ministry of our Sunday Divine Services.
                    </li></div>
                </ul>
            </div>

            The Tarkwa (3rd) edition in 2010 was sponsored by Mr. J. Stanley-Owusu of the JRO Memorial Methodist Church, McCarthy Hill, Accra, who was contacted by a past Connexional Coordinator, now Rev. Isaac Kwame Enninful.  It is therefore appropriate and fitting that the Festival has since then been christened: J. Stanley-Owusu Connexional Band Festival and with his continuous sponsorship.

            <p>
                The Festival has seen a remarkable change and improvement in the sound quality of our band units across the Connexion and has also attracted a broader patronage from four Dioceses in 2007 to ten in the 2012, 2014 and 2016 events.

                Subsequent to the Charge by the then Presiding Bishop, the Most Rev. Prof. Emmanuel K. Asante, in January 2015 to the Association for the Brigades to be seen in the Life, Mission and
                Service of the Church, as contained in his Keynote address at the Annual 7th All Captains and
                Officers Seminar that took place at the Methodist Youth Development and Training Centre at Aburi, the Connexional Executive therefore decided that first Saturday of March every year, starting from March 7, 2015, be set aside as the Connexional AMB Annual Social Awareness and Sanitation Day to be observed in all Societies and Manse premises for general cleaning by the Boys’ and Girls’ Brigades.  That was a quick and prompt response to the directive by the Presiding Bishop.
