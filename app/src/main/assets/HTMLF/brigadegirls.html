<div class="bh-boys"> <b style="color: red;" class="BH-boys">HISTORY OF GIRLS’ BRIGADE GHANA</b></div>
<p>
    The Girls’ Brigade came to Ghana in the year <b style="color:red">1955</b> through the efforts of the late <b style="color:navy">Mrs. Gladys Dagadu</b> who was the National President of Ghana Girls’ Brigade. The International Headquarters sent a Training Officer to Ghana in the person of <b style="color:navy">Miss Shanks</b> to assist in the extension work.
    The first Ghanaian Company – preparations as well as training were held at the <b style="color:navy">Methodist Mission House in James Town, Accra</b> with the help of the 1st Accra Company of the Boys’ Brigade which was already in existence.
</p>

<p>
    In 1955 the 1st Accra Company which was obviously the 1st Gold Coast Company was officially inaugurated at the Wesley Church, Zion Street, Accra by the late <b style="color:navy">Rev. J.K. Clegg</b> and the <b style="color:navy">late J.E. Addo</b>. We had cadets aged between six and eight years, seniors aged between ten and fourteen and Pioneers aged above fifteen years. Later, other companies spread into the Country notably the 1st Larteh Company, 1st Obuasi, 2nd Accra, 3rd Accra, 1st Sekondi, 1st Cape Coast and 1st Kumasi. This pioneering work was undertaken through the hard work of the late Mrs. Koram and Miss Shanks, a Scottish Brigade officer who was then teaching at Akropong.
    By <b style="color:red">1957</b> the Girls’ Life Brigade as it was known had been recognized as a youth movement of considerable standing. No doubt in the celebrations marking Ghana’s Independence in 1957 the Girls’ Life Brigade took part in this historic parade at the Accra Sports Stadium.

</p>

<p>
    It became necessary after Independence, to establish a National Council to steer the affairs of the Brigade. Members of the Council came from the Churches that had Brigade Companies and Youth and Women’s Fellowship. The Presbyterian Church was represented by <b style="color:navy">Miss Bachler</b>, the Anglican Church by <b style="color:navy">Miss Pearson</b>, the Methodist by <b style="color:navy">Rev. J.K. Clegg</b>, the E.P. Church by <b style="color:navy">Mrs. Vivian Hazel</b>, the Methodist Women’s Work by <b style="color:navy">Mrs. J.O. Noom</b>, the Christian Council by the then General Secretary, <b style="color:navy">Rev. T.A. Osei</b>, and <b style="color:navy">Miss Shanks</b>, who was then the Secretary for the Council.
</p>

<p>
    Programme was slow in the early days with isolated companies set up in Kumasi, Sekondi and Obuasi. In <b style="color:red">1961</b> moves were made to form a Council under the Chairmanship of Mrs. Dagadu but this too went through a difficult period until <b style="color:red">1963</b> when the Council was reformed and a constitution written. By then there were <b style="color:red">eleven (11) companies</b> established in the country.
</p>

<p>
    Much of the development may be attributed to the late <b style="color:navy">Mrs. R.M. Creedy</b>, a Methodist Missionary, who worked for a number of years as honorary National Secretary, <b style="color:navy">Miss Daphine Fletcher</b> and <b style="color:navy">Miss Kathleen McDonald</b> both workers in Nigeria, visited Ghana on separate occasions to encourage and help in training. <b style="color:navy">Miss H.M. Rae</b> International Secretary also visited Ghana.
</p>

<p>
    Further work in the Brigade was done by the <b style="color:navy">late Mrs. Rosemary Creedy</b> who struggled under difficult conditions for 12 years until she was called for higher service about some years ago. Her work during these twelve years showed results through the great expansion that took place. We appreciated her massive work and are thankful to God for providing her. May she rest in peace.
</p>

<p>
    We recall the wonderful assistance we have received from <b style="color:navy">Miss Hilda Rae</b>, the retired Overseas Secretary, whose good work is currently being continued by <b style="color:navy">Miss Sandra Kimber</b> who is now the Atlantic Secretary. We can also never forget Joyce and Basil Chaplain who helped in the formation of the Kumasi companies.
    In <b style="color:red">1969</b> <b style="color:navy">Mrs. Nancy Quansah</b> became the first Ghanaian Training Officer working in a voluntary capacity until <b style="color:red">1978</b> when she was officially appointed as the National Organizer/Secretary.
</p>

<p>
    Since her departure from the scene, <b style="color:navy">Mrs. Nancy Quansah</b> has been working as National Organizer/Secretary under whose guidance we hope to continue expansion work, particularly in the Volta Region. We shall be doing a great deal of injustice if we fail to record on thanks to all our friends without whose sustained help little could have been achieved over the past years.
</p>

<p>
    Nancy joined the Girls’ Brigade in Accra in <b style="color:red">1955</b> as a Lieutenant. In <b style="color:red">1957</b>, she was transferred to Takoradi and started a company there. In <b style="color:red">1967</b> she returned to Accra and took over as Captain of the 1st Accra Company from Mrs. Dagadu who was then the National President.
</p>

<p>
    The first Girls’ Brigade International Council Meetings were held in <b style="color:navy">London</b> in <b style="color:red">1968</b> and Nancy attended as Ghana’s representative. She took full advantage of her journey to stayed on for further training at International Headquarters.
</p>

<p>
    The work of a National Organizer/Secretary is very varied. Responsible for every part of Ghana where Brigade is functioning; the work entails a great future leaders for extension and helping to increase the efficiency of the present officers. She organizes National Training Courses, helps the Regional Commissioners to hold their own local courses and visits companies regularly.
</p>

<p>
    As Secretary, she is responsible for all the office work connected with the running of the National Council, keeping records and maintaining communication with the company officer.
    Hopes for the future include extension of the work into the Volta Region and seeking to establish more vocational training opportunities, i.e. training in practical skills like sewing and other handicrafts, for girls who cannot go to secondary school and who cannot find work. One scheme to help the unemployed girl was set up in Koforidua where they have a canteen, which caters for ten schools in the Betom area. It is hoped that other companies will take up similar projects.
</p>

<p>
    Ghana became a full member of the International Council in <b style="color:red">1973</b>. Presently, the Girls’ Brigade in Ghana is a lively organization working mostly within the Methodist, Presbyterian and Anglican Churches.
    The 3rd B.I.C. of the Girls’ Brigade was held in <b style="color:navy">Cayman Island</b> and <b>Miss Beatrice B. Oduro</b> represented the Ghana Girls’ Brigade. After the conference she came to London Headquarters to acquaint herself with the Brigade family for six weeks.
</p>

<p>
    Ghana is divided into Regions and each Region has a Brigade Commissioner and she represents her area on the Brigade National Council which meets fairly regularly. Each year they hold an Officers’ Conference and AGM which any officer may attend.
