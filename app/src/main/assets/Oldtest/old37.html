    <b style="font-weight: bold;">IN THE PRISON, </b>the hair of his head began to grow again as soon as he was shaved.

    Then the rulers of the Philistines assembled to offer a great sacrifice to their god Dagon and to rejoice, for they said, "Our god has given Samson, our enemy, into our power." When the people saw him, they also praised their god, saying:

<P>
    "Our god has laid low our foe, He who brought our country woe, He who slew us with many a blow."
</P>

<P>
    When they were in high spirits, they said, "Call Samson that he may amuse us." So, they called Samson from the prison and he amused them; and they placed him between the pillars.
</P>

<P>
    Then Samson said to the young man who held him by the hand, "Let me touch the pillars on which the building rests, that I may lean against them." Now the building was full of men and women, and all the rulers of the Philistines were there, and on the roof about three thousand men and women were looking on while Samson amused them. Samson called on Jehovah and said, "O Jehovah, remember me and strengthen me, I pray thee, just this once, O God, that by one act I may avenge myself on the Philistines for the loss of my two eyes."
</P>

<P>
    Then Samson took hold of the two middle pillars upon which the building rested, one with his right hand and the other with his left, and leaned against them. And Samson said, "Let me die with the Philistines." Then he bent over with all his strength, and the house fell upon the rulers and upon all the people who were in it. So those whom he killed at his death were more than those whom he killed during his lifetime.
</P>

<P>
    Then his brothers and all his family came down and took him away and buried him between Zorah and Eshtaol in the burying-place of Manoah his father.
